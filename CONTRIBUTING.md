# Contributing to Ferry

## Create a new issue

The easiest way to get involved is to create a [new issue](https://github.com/gql-dart/ferry/issues/new) when you spot a bug, if the documentation is incomplete or out of date, or if you identify an implementation problem.

## General coding guidlines

If you'd like to add a feature or fix a bug, we're more than happy to accept pull requests! We only ask a few things:

- Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This allows us to automatically build changelogs and publish `alpha` releases.
- Ensure your code contains no analyzer errors.
- Format your code with `dartfmt`.
- Write tests for all new code paths, consider using the [Stream Matchers](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/test#stream-matchers) available from the test package.
- Write helpful documentation
- If you would like to make a bigger / fundamental change to the codebase, please file a lightweight example PR / issue first.
